This is a Web app project created using REACT.

Inspiration for the UI was taken from pre-exsiting sporting websites such as espn.com and NFL.com.

To run this application make sure you have React and Node.js installed. 
  I also had to use a chrome extension called "Moesif CORS" to handle the API being used in this project.
  
The header was added only for context purposes to add to the UI design. In the brief I was given it said:

  "This is ACME Sports’ first website and they don’t understand tech, UX or SEO. So, they are  relying on you for all aspects of this initiative – user experience, SEO and  technical  implementation."

Therefore, I thought showing what the application could look like in a full website setting would be helpful to the client.
  Even through in a logo design I made using Adobe Illustrator.
  I created the UI design using Adobe XD before starting to have a reference as I coded.
  
Although the search bar in the header is for looks, the NFL teams search bar is functioning. It can filter and display using the team names, conference and divison.

The football images are also meant more as a placeholder for UI purposes. Due to no image urls being inclded in the JSON file.
  Also, due other things I would have added if they were included in the JSON would be links to other section of the sites to keep the user on their page.
  I would rearrange the team cards to also include links to perhaps team pages, blog posts relating to the team or a link to other options listed in the white dropdown menu.
